The underlying infrastructure of each platform is abstracted, meaning that users can expect pre-configured runtime environments and predictable scaling, storage, and security options. They also have access to languages, libraries, tools, and services for application development, as well as a certain degree of control over configuration settings; however, they do not have the ability to modify the underlying operating system or network settings.

## Packet

Packets are the basic data units transmitted through a TCP/IP network. Originally conceived as a way to transmit data without a pre-established connection, packets make dynamic data transference possible. Data in a packet falls into two categories: control information (source and destination network addresses, sequence information, and error detection codes), and user data (the content of the message itself).

## Partition

A partition is a share of a hard disk or other secondary storage device, allowing an operating system to manage data and information in each partition separately. This can be advantageous for data security, as it simplifies data backups and reduces the risk of losing data. Partitioning also provides a convenient means for storing multiple operating systems on the same drive.
