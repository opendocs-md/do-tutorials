# How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment on macOS

## Introduction

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is an open source JavaScript runtime environment for easily building server-side applications. It‚Äôs also the runtime that powers many client-side development tools for modern JavaScript frameworks.

In this tutorial, you‚Äôll set up a Node.js programming environment on your local macOS machine using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), and you‚Äôll test your environment out by writing a simple Node.js program.

## Prerequisites

You will need a macOS computer running High Sierra or higher with administrative access and an internet connection.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Using the macOS Terminal

You‚Äôll use the command line to install Node.js and run various commands related to developing Node.js applications. The command line is a non-graphical way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking buttons with your mouse, you‚Äôll type commands as text and receive text-based feedback. The command line, also known as a shell, lets you automate many tasks you do on your computer daily, and is an essential tool for software developers.

To access the command line interface, you‚Äôll use the Terminal application provided by macOS. Like any other application, you can find it by going into Finder, navigating to the Applications folder, and then into the Utilities folder. From here, double-click the Terminal application to open it up. Alternatively, you can use Spotlight by holding down the `COMMAND` key and pressing `SPACE` to find Terminal by typing it out in the box that appears.

If you‚Äôd like to get comfortable using the command line, take a look at [An Introduction to the Linux Terminal](an-introduction-to-the-linux-terminal). The command line interface on macOS is very similar, and the concepts in that tutorial are directly applicable.

Now that you have the Terminal running, let‚Äôs install some prerequisites we‚Äôll need for Node.js.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Installing Xcode‚Äôs Command Line Tools

Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is comprised of software development tools for macOS. You won‚Äôt need Xcode to write Node.js programs, but Node.js and some of its components will rely on Xcode‚Äôs Command Line Tools package.

Execute this command in the Terminal to download and install these components:

    xcode-select --install

You‚Äôll be prompted to start the installation, and then prompted again to accept a software license. Then the tools will download and install automatically.

We‚Äôre now ready to install the package manager Homebrew, which will let us install the latest version of Node.js.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Installing and Setting Up Homebrew

While the command line interface on macOS has a lot of the functionality you‚Äôd find in Linux and other Unix systems, it does not ship with a good package manager. A _package manager_ is a collection of software tools that work to automate software installations, configurations, and upgrades. They keep the software they install in a central location and can maintain all software packages on the system in formats that are commonly used. [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a free and open-source software package managing system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS. We‚Äôll use Homebrew to install the most recent version of Node.js.

To install Homebrew, type this command into your Terminal window:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

The command uses `curl` to download the Homebrew installation script from Homebrew‚Äôs Git repository on GitHub.

Let‚Äôs walk through the flags that are associated with the `curl` command:

- The -`f` or `--fail` flag tells the Terminal window to give no HTML document output on server errors.
- The `-s` or `--silent` flag mutes `curl` so that it does not show the progress meter, and combined with the `-S` or `--show-error` flag it will ensure that `curl` shows an error message if it fails.
- The `-L` or `--location` flag will tell `curl` to handle redirects. If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location, it‚Äôll automatically execute the request again using the new location.

Once `curl` downloads the script, it‚Äôs then executed by the Ruby interpreter that ships with macOS, starting the Homebrew installation process.

The installation script will explain what it will do and will prompt you to confirm that you want to do it. This lets you know exactly what Homebrew is going to do to your system before you let it proceed. It also ensures you have the prerequisites in place before it continues.

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter your password during the process. However, when you type your password, your keystrokes will not display in the Terminal window. This is a security measure and is something you‚Äôll see often when prompted for passwords on the command line. Even though you don‚Äôt see them, your keystrokes are being recorded by the system, so press the `RETURN` key once you‚Äôve entered your password.

Press the letter `y` for ‚Äúyes‚Äù whenever you are prompted to confirm the installation.

Now let‚Äôs verify that Homebrew is set up correctly. Execute this command:

    brew doctor

If no updates are required at this time, you‚Äôll see this in your Terminal:

    OutputYour system is ready to brew.

Otherwise, you may get a warning to run another command such as `brew update` to ensure that your installation of Homebrew is up to date.

Now that Homebrew is installed, you can install Node.js.

## Step 4 ‚Äî Installing Node.js

With Homebrew installed, you can install a wide range of software and developer tools. We‚Äôll use it to install Node.js and its dependencies.

You can use Homebrew to search for everything you can install with the `brew search` command, but to provide us with a shorter list, let‚Äôs instead search for packages related to Node.js:

    brew search nodejs

You‚Äôll see a list of packages you can install, like this:

    Output==> Formulae
    node.js
    nodejs

Both of these packages install Node.js on your system. They both exist just in case you can‚Äôt remember if you need to use `nodejs` or `node.js`.

Execute this command to install the `nodejs` package:

    brew install nodejs

You‚Äôll see output similar to the following in your Terminal. Homebrew will install many dependencies, but will eventually download and install Node.js itself:

    Output==> Installing dependencies for node: icu4c
    ==> Installing node dependency: icu4c
    
    ==> Installing node
    ==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/node-11.0.0.sierra.bottle.tar.gz
    ######################################################################## 100.0%
    ==> Pouring node-11.0.0.sierra.bottle.tar.gz
    ...
    
    ==> Summary
    üç∫ /usr/local/Cellar/node/11.0.0: 3,936 files, 50.1MB

In addition to Node.js itself, Homebrew installs a few related tools, including `npm`, which makes it easy to install and update Node.js libraries and packages you might use in your own projects.

To check the version of Node.js that you installed, type

    node -v

This will output the specific version of Node.js that is currently installed, which will by default be the most up-to-date stable version of Node.js that is available.

    Outputv11.0.0

Check the version of `npm` with

    npm -v

You‚Äôll see the version displayed:

    Output6.4.1

You‚Äôll use `npm` to install additional components, libraries, and frameworks.

To update your version of Node.js, you can first update Homebrew to get the latest list of packages, and then upgrade Node.js itself:

    brew update
    brew upgrade nodejs

Now that Node.js is installed, let‚Äôs write a program to ensure everything works.

## Step 5 ‚Äî Creating a Simple Program

Let‚Äôs create a simple ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù program. This will make sure that our environment is working and gets you comfortable creating and running a Node.js program.

To do this, create a new file called `hello.js` using `nano`:

    nano hello.js

Type the following code into the file:

hello.js

    let message = "Hello, World!";
    console.log(message);

Exit the editor by pressing `CTRL+X`. Then press `y` when prompted to save the file. You‚Äôll be returned to your prompt.

Now run the program with the following command:

    node hello.js

The program executes and displays its output to the screen:

    OutputHello, World!

This simple program proves that you have a working development environment. You can use this environment to continue exploring Node.js and build larger, more interesting projects.

## Conclusion

You‚Äôve successfully installed Node.js, `npm`, and tested out your setup by creating and running a simple program. You can now use this to develop client-side apps or server-side apps. Take a look at the following tutorials to learn more:
