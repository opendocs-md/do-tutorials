# How To Monitor Your Ubuntu 16.04 System with Sysdig

## Introduction

[Sysdig](http://www.sysdig.org/) is a comprehensive open-source system activity monitoring, capture and analysis application. It features a powerful filtering language with customizable output, and core functionality that can be extended with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripts called _chisels_.

The application works by tapping into the kernel, which allows it to see every system call and all of the information passing through the kernel. This also makes it an excellent tool for monitoring and analyzing system activity and events generated by application containers running on a system.

The core Sysdig application monitors the server it is installed on. However, the company behind the project offers a hosted version called Sysdig Cloud that can monitor any number of servers remotely.

The standalone application is available on most Linux distributions, but it’s also available, with more limited functionality, on Windows and macOS. Aside from the `sysdig` command line tool, Sysdig also comes with an interactive UI called `csysdig` with similar options.

In this tutorial, you’ll install and use Sysdig to monitor an Ubuntu 16.04 server. You’ll stream live events, save events to files, filter results, and explore the `csysdig` interactive UI.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you’ll need:

- One Ubuntu 16.04 server set up by following [the Ubuntu 16.04 initial server setup guide](initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04), including a sudo non-root user and a firewall.

## Step 1 – Installing Sysdig Using the Official Script

There’s a Sysdig package in the Ubuntu repository, but it’s usually a revision or two behind the current version. At the time of publication, for example, installing Sysdig using Ubuntu’s package manager will get you Sysdig 0.8.0. However, you can install it using an official script from the project’s development page, which is the recommended method of installation. This is the method we’ll use.

But first, update the package database to ensure you have the latest list of available packages:

    sudo apt-get update

Now download Sysdig’s installation script with `curl` using the following command:

    curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/download.draios.com/stable/install-sysdig -o install-sysdig

This downloads the installation script to the file `install-sysdig` to the current folder. You’ll need to execute this script with elevated privileges, and it’s dangerous to run scripts you download from the Internet. Before you execute the script, audit its content by opening it in a text editor or by using the `less` command to display the contents on the screen:

    less ./install-sysdig

Once you’re comfortable with the commands the script will run, execute the script with the following command:

    cat ./install-sysdig | sudo bash

The command will install all dependencies, including kernel headers and modules. The output of the installation will be similar to the following:

    Output* Detecting operating system
    * Installing Sysdig public key
    OK
    * Installing sysdig repository
    * Installing kernel headers
    * Installing sysdig
    
    ...
    
    sysdig-probe:
    Running module version sanity check.
     - Original module
       - No original module exists within this kernel
     - Installation
       - Installing to /lib/modules/4.4.0-59-generic/updates/dkms/
    
    depmod....
    
    DKMS: install completed.
    Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.23-0ubuntu5) ...

Now that you’ve got Sysdig installed, let’s look at some ways to use it.

## Step 2 – Monitoring Your System in Real-Time

In this section, you’ll use the `sysdig` command to look at some events on your Ubuntu 16.04 server. The `sysdig` command requires root privileges to run, and it takes any number of options and filters. The simplest way to run the command is without any arguments. This will give you a real-time view of system data refreshed every two seconds:

    sudo sysdig

But, as you’ll see as soon as you run the command, it can be difficult to analyze the data being written to the screen because it streams continuously, and there are lots of events happening on your server. Stop `sysdig` by pressing `CTRL+C`.

Before we run the command again with some options, let’s get familiar with the output by looking at a sample output from the command:

    Output253566 11:16:42.808339958 0 sshd (12392) > rt_sigprocmask
    253567 11:16:42.808340777 0 sshd (12392) < rt_sigprocmask
    253568 11:16:42.808341072 0 sshd (12392) > rt_sigprocmask
    253569 11:16:42.808341377 0 sshd (12392) < rt_sigprocmask
    253570 11:16:42.808342432 0 sshd (12392) > clock_gettime
    253571 11:16:42.808343127 0 sshd (12392) < clock_gettime
    253572 11:16:42.808344269 0 sshd (12392) > read fd=10(<f>/dev/ptmx) size=16384
    253573 11:16:42.808346955 0 sshd (12392) < read res=2 data=..

The output’s columns are:

    Output%evt.num %evt.outputtime %evt.cpu %proc.name (%thread.tid) %evt.dir %evt.type %evt.info

Here’s what each column means:

- **evt.num** is the incremental event number.
- **evt.outputtime** is the event timestamp, which you can customize.
- **evt.cpu** is the CPU number where the event was captured. In the above output, the **evt.cpu** is **0** , which is the server’s first CPU.
- **proc.name** is the name of the process that generated the event.
- **thread.tid** is the TID that generated the event, which corresponds to the PID for single thread processes.
- **evt.dir** is the event direction. You’ll see **\>** for enter events and **\<** for exit events.
- **evt.type** is the name of the event, e.g. ‘open’, 'read’, 'write’, etc.
- **evt.info** is the list of event arguments. In case of system calls, these tend to correspond to the system call arguments, but that’s not always the case: some system call arguments are excluded for simplicity or performance reasons.

There’s hardly any value in running `sysdig` like you did in the previous command because there’s so much information streaming in. But you can apply options and filters to the command using this syntax:

    sudo sysdig [option] [filter]

You can view the complete list of available filters using:

    sysdig -l

There’s an extensive list of filters spanning several classes, or categories. Here are some of the classes:

- **fd** : Filter on file descriptor (FD) information, like FD numbers and FD names.
- **process** : Filter on process information, like id and name of the process that generated an event.
- **evt** : Filter on event information, like event number and time.
- **user** : Filter on user information, like user id, username, user’s home directory or login shell.
- **group** : Filter on group information, like group id and name.
- **syslog** : Filter on syslog information, like facility and severity.
- **fdlist** : Filter on file descriptor for poll events.

Since it’s not practical to cover every filter in this tutorial, let’s just try a couple, starting with the **syslog.severity.str** filter in the **syslog** class, which lets you view messages sent to syslog at a specific severity level. This command shows messages sent to syslog at the “information” level:

    sudo sysdig syslog.severity.str=info

**Notes:** Depending on the level of activity on your server, you might not see any output after typing this command, or it might take a long time before you see any output. To force issues, open another terminal emulator and perform an action that will generate a message to syslog. For example, perform a package update, upgrade the system, or install any package.

Kill the command by pressing `CTRL+C`.

The output, which should be fairly easy to interpret, should look something like this:

    Output10716 03:15:37.111266382 0 sudo (26322) < sendto syslog sev=info msg=Jan 24 03:15:37 sudo: pam_unix(sudo:session): session opened for user root b

You can also filter on a single process. For example, to look for events from `nano`, execute this command:

    sudo sysdig proc.name=nano

Since this command filers on `nano`, you will have to use the `nano` text editor to open a file to see any output. Open another terminal editor, connect to your server, and use `nano` to open a text file. Write a few characters and save the file. Then return to your original terminal.

You’ll then see some output similar to this:

    Output21840 11:26:33.390634648 0 nano (27291) < mmap res=7F517150A000 vm_size=8884 vm_rss=436 vm_swap=0

    21842 11:26:33.390657136 0 nano (27291) < close res=0
    21843 11:26:33.390682336 0 nano (27291) > access mode=0(F_OK)
    21844 11:26:33.390690897 0 nano (27291) < access res=-2(ENOENT) name=/etc/ld.so.nohwcap
    21845 11:26:33.390695494 0 nano (27291) > open
    21846 11:26:33.390708360 0 nano (27291) < open fd=3(<f>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2) name=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 flags=4097(O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) mode=0
    21847 11:26:33.390710510 0 nano (27291) > read fd=3(<f>/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2) size=832

Again, kill the command by typing `CTRL+C`.

Getting a real time view of system events using `sysdig` is not always the best method of using it. Luckily, there’s another way - capturing events to a file for analysis at a later time. Let’s look at how.

## Step 3 – Capturing System Activity to a File Using Sysdig

Capturing system events to a file using `sysdig` lets you analyze those events at a later time. To save system events to a file, pass `sysdig` the **-w** option and specify a target file name, like this:

    sudo sysdig -w sysdig-trace-file.scap

Sysdig will keep saving generated events to the target file until you press `CTRL+C`. With time, that file can grow quite large. With the **-n** option, however, you can specify how many events you want Sysdig to capture. After the target number of events have been captured, it will exit. For example, to save 300 events to a file, type:

    sudo sysdig -n 300 -w sysdig-file.scap

Though you can use Sysdig to capture a specified number of events to a file, a better approach would be to use the **-C** option to break up a capture into smaller files of a specific size. And to not overwhelm the local storage, you can instruct Sysdig to keep only a few of the saved files. In other words, Sysdig supports capturing events to logs with file rotation, in one command.

For example, to save events continuously to files that are no more than 1 MB in size, and only keep the last five files (that’s what the **-W** option does), execute this command:

    sudo sysdig -C 1 -W 5 -w sysdig-trace.scap

List the files using `ls -l sysdig-trace*` and you’ll see output similar to this, with five log files:

    Output-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 985K Nov 23 04:13 sysdig-trace.scap0
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 952K Nov 23 04:14 sysdig-trace.scap1
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 985K Nov 23 04:13 sysdig-trace.scap2
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 985K Nov 23 04:13 sysdig-trace.scap3
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 985K Nov 23 04:13 sysdig-trace.scap4

As with real-time capture, you can apply filters to saved events. For example, to save 200 events generated by the process `nano`, type this command:

    sudo sysdig -n 200 -w sysdig-trace-nano.scap proc.name=nano

Then, in another terminal connected to your server, open a file with `nano` and generate some events by typing text or saving the file. The events will be captured to `sysdig-trace-nano.scap` until `sysdig` records 200 events.

How would you go about capturing all write events generated on your server? You would apply the filter like this:

    sudo sysdig -w sysdig-write-events.scap evt.type=write

Press `CTRL+C` after a few moments to exit.

You can do a whole lot more when saving system activity to a file using `sysdig`, but these examples should have given you a pretty good idea of how to go about it. Let’s look at how to analyze these files.

## Step 4 – Reading and Analyzing Event Data with Sysdig

Reading captured data from a file with Sysdig is as simple as passing the **-r** switch to the `sysdig` command, like this:

    sudo sysdig -r sysdig-trace-file.scap

That will dump the entire content of the file to the screen, which is not really the best approach, especially if the file is large. Luckily, you can apply the same filters when reading the file that you applied to it while it was being written.

For example, to read the `sysdig-trace-nano.scap` trace file you created, but only look at a specific type of event, like write events, type this command:

    sysdig -r sysdig-trace-nano.scap evt.type=write

The output should be similar to:

    Output21340 13:32:14.577121096 0 nano (27590) < write res=1 data=.
    21736 13:32:17.378737309 0 nano (27590) > write fd=1 size=23
    21737 13:32:17.378748803 0 nano (27590) < write res=23 data=#This is a test file..#
    21752 13:32:17.611797048 0 nano (27590) > write fd=1 size=24

    21864 13:32:18.500692107 0 nano (27590) > write fd=1 size=25
    21865 13:32:18.500714395 0 nano (27590) < write res=25 data=iThis is a test file..[6G
    21880 13:32:18.529249448 0 nano (27590) > write fd=1 size=25
    21881 13:32:18.529258664 0 nano (27590) < write res=25 data=sThis is a test file..[7G
    21896 13:32:18.620305802 0 nano (27590) > write fd=1 size=25

Let’s look at the contents of the file you saved in the previous section: the `sysdig-write-events.scap` file. We know that all events saved to the file are write events, so let’s view the contents:

    sudo sysdig -r sysdig-write-events.scap evt.type=write

This is a partial output. You will see something like this if there was any SSH activity on the server when you captured the events:

Notice that all the lines in the preceding output contain **11.11.11.11:51282-\>22.22.22.22:ssh**. Those are events coming from the external IP address of the client, `11.11.11.11` to the IP address of the server, `22.22.22.22` . These events occurred over an SSH connection to the server, so those events are expected. But are there other SSH write events that are not from this known client IP address? It’s easy to find out.

There are many comparison operators you can use with Sysdig. The first one you saw is **=**. Others are **!=** , **\>** , **\>=** , **\<** , and **\<=**. In the following command, **fd.rip** filters on remote IP address. We’ll use the **!=** comparison operator to look for events that are from IP addresses other than `11.11.11.11`:

    sysdig -r sysdig-write-events.scap fd.rip!=11.11.11.11

A partial output, which showed that there were write events from IP addresses other than the client IP address, is shown in the following output:

Further investigation also showed that the rogue IP address `33.33.33.33` belonged to a machine in China. That’s something to worry about! That’s just one example of how you can use Sysdig to keep a watchful eye on traffic hitting your server.

Let’s look at using some additional scripts to analyze the event stream.

## Step 5 – Using Sysdig Chisels for System Monitoring and Analysis

In Sysdig parlance, _chisels_ are Lua scripts you can use that analyze the Sysdig event stream to perform useful actions. There are close to 50 scripts that ship with every Sysdig installation, and you can view a list of available chisels on your system using this command:

    sysdig -cl

Some of the more interesting chisels include:

- **netstat** : List (and optionally filter) network connections.
- **shellshock\_detect** : Print [shellshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug)) attacks
- **spy\_users** : Display interactive user activity.
- **list_login_shells** : List the login shell IDs.
- **spy\_ip** : Show the data exchanged with the given IP address.
- **spy\_port** : Show the data exchanged using the given IP port number.
- **spy\_file** : Echo any read or write made by any process to all files. Optionally, you can provide the name of a file to only intercept reads or writes to that file.
- **httptop** : Show the top HTTP requests

For a more detailed description of a chisel, including any associated arguments, use the `-i` flag, followed by the name of the chisel. So, for example, to view more information about the `netstat` chisel, type:

    sysdig -i netstat

Now that you know all you need to know about using that `netstat` chisel, tap into its power to monitor your system by running:

    sudo sysdig -c netstat

The output should be similar to the following:

    OutputProto Server Address Client Address State TID/PID/Program Name
    tcp 22.22.22.22:22 11.11.11.11:60422 ESTABLISHED 15567/15567/sshd
    tcp 0.0.0.0:22 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1613/1613/sshd

If you see **ESTABLISHED** SSH connections from an IP address other than yours in the **Client Address** column, that should be a red flag, and you should probe deeper.

A far more interesting chisel is `spy_users`, which lets you view interactive user activity on the system.

Exit this command:

    sudo sysdig -c spy_users

Then, open a second terminal and connect to your server. Execute some commands in that second terminal, then return to your terminal running `sysdig`. The commands you typed in the first terminal will be echoed on the terminal that you executed the `sysdig -c spy_users` command on.

Next, let’s explore Csysdig, a graphical tool.

## Step 6 – Using Csysdig for System Monitoring and Analysis

Csysdig is the other utility that comes with Sysdig. It has an interactive user interface that offers the same features available on the command line with `sysdig`. It’s like `top`, `htop` and `strace`, but more feature-rich.

Like the `sysdig` command, the `csysdig` command can perform live monitoring and can capture events to a file for later analysis. But `csysdig` gives you a more useful real time view of system data refreshed every two seconds. To see an example of that, type the following command:

    sudo csysdig

That will open an interface like the one in the following figure, which shows event data generated by all users and applications on the monitored host.

![Main interface of Csysdig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendocs-md/do-tutorials-images/master/img/sysdig_ubuntu_1604/LEhCwvI.jpg)

At the bottom of the interface are several buttons you can use to access the different aspects of the program. Most notable is the **Views** button, which is akin to categories of metrics collected by `csysdig`. There are 29 views available out of the box, including **Processes** , **System Calls** , **Threads** , **Containers** , **Processes CPU** , **Page Faults** , **Files** , and **Directories**.

When you start `csysdig` without arguments, you’ll see live events from the **Processes** view. By clicking on the **Views** button, or pressing the `F2` key, you’ll see the list of available views, including a description of the columns. You may also view a description of the columns by pressing the `F7` key or by clicking the **Legend** button. And a summary man page of the application itself (`csysdig`) is accessible by pressing the `F1` key or clicking on the **Help** button.

The following image shows a listing of the application’s **Views** interface.

![Csysdig views window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendocs-md/do-tutorials-images/master/img/sysdig_ubuntu_1604/R7oHhHT.jpg)

**Notes:** For every button, there’s a corresponding keyboard shortcut, or hotkey, to the left side of the button. Pressing a shortcut key twice will get you back to the previous window. Pressing the `ESC` key will achieve the same result.

Though you can run `csysdig` without any options and arguments, the command’s syntax, as with `sysdig`’s, usually takes this form:

    sudo csysdig [option]... [filter]

The most common option is **-d** , which is used to modify the delay between updates in milliseconds. For example, to view `csysdig` output updated every 10 seconds, instead of the default of 2 seconds, type:

    sudo csysdig -d 10000

You can exclude the user and group information from views with the **-E** option:

    sudo csysdig -E

This can make `csysdig` start up faster, but the speed gain is negligible in most situations.

To instruct `csysdig` to stop capturing after a certain number of events, use the **-n** option. The application will exit after that number has been reached. The number of captured events has to be in the five figures; otherwise you won’t even see the `csysdig` UI:

    sudo csysdig -n 100000

To analyze a trace file, pass `csysdig` the **-r** option, like so:

    sudo csysdig -r sysdig-trace-file.scap

You can use the same filters you used with `sysdig` to restrict `csysdig`’s output. So, for example, rather than viewing event data generated by all users on the system, you can filter the output by users by launching `csysdig` with the following command, which will show event data only generated by the root user:

    sudo csysdig user.name=root

The output should be similar to the one shown in the following image, although the output will reflect what’s running on your server:

![Csysdig data generated by root](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendocs-md/do-tutorials-images/master/img/sysdig_ubuntu_1604/CFsMTrH.jpg)

To view the output for an executable generating an event, pass the filter the name of the binary without the path. The following example will show all events generated by the `nano` command. In other words, it will show all open files where the text editor is `nano`:

    sudo csysdig proc.name=nano

There are several dozen filters available, which you can view with the following command:

    sudo csysdig -l

You’ll notice that that was the same option you used to view the filters available with `sysdig` command. So `sysdig` and `csysdig` are just about the same. The main difference is that `csysdig` comes with a mouse-friendly interactive UI. To exit `csysdig` at any time, press the `Q` key on your keyboard.

## Conclusion

Sysdig helps you monitor and troubleshoot your server. It will give you a deep insight into all the system activity on a monitored host, including those generated by application containers. While this tutorial didn’t cover containers specificially, the ability to monitor system acticity generated by containers is what sets Sysdig apart from similar applications. More information is available on the project’s [home page](http://www.sysdig.org/).

Sysdig’s chisels are a powerful extension of the core Sysdig functionality. They’re written in Lua, so you can alway customize them or write one from scratch.
