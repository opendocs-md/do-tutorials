# How To Install Nagios 4 and Monitor Your Servers on Ubuntu 16.04

## Introduction

[Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/) is a popular open-source monitoring system. It keeps an inventory of your servers and monitors them so you know your critical services are up and running. Using a monitoring system like Nagios is an essential tool for any production environment, because by monitoring uptime, CPU usage, or disk space, you can head off problems before they occur, or before your users call you.

In this tutorial, you’ll install Nagios 4 and configure it so you can monitor host resources via Nagios’ web interface. You’ll also set up the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE), which runs as an agent on remote hosts so you can monitor their resources.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:

- Two Ubuntu 16.04 servers with [private networking](how-to-create-your-first-digitalocean-droplet#step-6-%E2%80%94-selecting-additional-options) configured, set up by following [the Ubuntu 16.04 initial server setup guide](initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04), including a sudo non-root user and a firewall. You’ll use the first server to run Nagios, and the second server will be configured as a remote host that Nagios can monitor.
  - The server that will run Nagios also needs Apache and PHP installed, which you can do by following [How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP stack) on Ubuntu 16.04](how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04). You can skip the MySQL steps in that tutorial.
- Typically, Nagios runs behind a hardware firewall or VPN. If your Nagios server is exposed to the public Internet, you should secure the Nagios web interface with TLS. To do this, you should do one of the following:
  - Configure a domain name to point to your server. You can learn how to point domains to DigitalOcean Droplets by following the [How To Set Up a Host Name with DigitalOcean](how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean) tutorial, and then follow [How To Secure Apache with Let’s Encrypt on Ubuntu 16.04](how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04) to set up HTTPS support
  - Secure Apache with a self-signed certificate by following [How To Create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate for Apache in Ubuntu 16.04](how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-apache-in-ubuntu-16-04) 

This tutorial assumes that your servers have [private networking](how-to-set-up-and-use-digitalocean-private-networking) enabled so that monitoring happens on the private network rather than the public network. If you don’t have private networking enabled, you can still follow this tutorial by replacing all the references to private IP addresses with public IP addresses.

## Step 1 — Installing Nagios 4

There are multiple ways to install Nagios, but we’ll install Nagios and its components from source to ensure we get the latest features, security updates, and bug fixes.

Log into your server that runs Apache. We’ll call this the **Nagios server**.

    ssh sammy@your_nagios_server_ip

Create a **nagios** user and **nagcmd** group. You’ll use these to run the Nagios process.

    sudo useradd nagios
    sudo groupadd nagcmd

Then add the user to the group:

    sudo usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios

Because we are building Nagios and its components from source, we must install a few development libraries to complete the build, including compilers, development headers, and OpenSSL.

Update your package lists to ensure you can download the latest versions of the prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get update

Then install the required packages:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgd2-xpm-dev openssl libssl-dev unzip

With the prerequisites installed, we can install Nagios itself. Download the source code for the latest stable release of Nagios Core. Go to the [Nagios downloads page](http://www.nagios.org/download/core-stay-informed), and click the **Skip to download** link below the form. Copy the link address for the latest stable release so you can download it to your Nagios server.

Download the release to your home directory with the `curl` command:

    cd ~
    curl -L -O https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz

Extract the Nagios archive:

    tar zxf nagios-*.tar.gz

Then change to the extracted directory:

    cd nagios-*

Before building Nagios, run the `configure` script to specify the user and group you want Nagios to use. Use the **nagios** user and **nagcmd** group you created:

    ./configure --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-command-group=nagcmd

If you want Nagios to send emails using Postfix, you must [install Postfix](how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-on-ubuntu-16-04) and configure Nagios to use it by adding `--with-mail=/usr/sbin/sendmail` to the `configure` command. We won’t cover Postfix in this tutorial, but if you choose to use Postfix and Nagios later, you’ll need to reconfigure and reinstall Nagios to use Postfix support.

You’ll see the following output from the `configure` command:

    Output ***Configuration summary for nagios 4.3.4 2017-08-24*** :
    
     General Options:
     -------------------------
            Nagios executable: nagios
            Nagios user/group: nagios,nagios
           Command user/group: nagios,nagcmd
                 Event Broker: yes
            Install ${prefix}: /usr/local/nagios
        Install ${includedir}: /usr/local/nagios/include/nagios
                    Lock file: /run/nagios.lock
       Check result directory: ${prefix}/var/spool/checkresults
               Init directory: /etc/init.d
      Apache conf.d directory: /etc/apache2/sites-available
                 Mail program: /bin/mail
                      Host OS: linux-gnu
              IOBroker Method: epoll
    
     Web Interface Options:
     ------------------------
                     HTML URL: http://localhost/nagios/
                      CGI URL: http://localhost/nagios/cgi-bin/
     Traceroute (used by WAP):
    
    
    Review the options above for accuracy. If they look okay,
    type 'make all' to compile the main program and CGIs.

Now compile Nagios with this command:

    make all

Now run these `make` commands to install Nagios, its init scripts, and its default configuration files:

    sudo make install
    sudo make install-commandmode
    sudo make install-init
    sudo make install-config

You’ll use Apache to serve Nagios’ web interface, so copy the sample Apache configuration file to the `/etc/apache2/sites-available` folder:

    sudo /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 sample-config/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

In order to issue external commands via the web interface to Nagios, add the web server user, **www-data** , to the **nagcmd** group:

    sudo usermod -G nagcmd www-data

Nagios is now installed. Let’s install a plugin which will allow Nagios to collect data from various hosts.

## Step 2 — Installing the check\_nrpe Plugin

Nagios monitors remote hosts using the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor, or NRPE. It consists of two pieces:

- The `check_nrpe` plugin which is used by Nagios server.
- The NRPE daemon, which runs on the remote hosts and sends data to the Nagios server.

Let’s install the `check_nrpe` plugin on our Nagios server.

Find the download URL for the latest stable release of NRPE at the [Nagios Exchange site](https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Monitoring-Agents/NRPE--2D-Nagios-Remote-Plugin-Executor/details).

Download it to your home directory with `curl`:

    cd ~
    curl -L -O https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/releases/download/nrpe-3.2.1/nrpe-3.2.1.tar.gz

Extract the NRPE archive:

    tar zxf nrpe-*.tar.gz

Then change to the extracted directory:

    cd nrpe-*

Configure the `check_nrpe` plugin:

    ./configure

Now build and install `check_nrpe`:

    make check_nrpe
    sudo make install-plugin

Let’s configure the Nagios server next.

## Step 3 — Configuring Nagios

Now let’s perform the initial Nagios configuration, which involves editing some configuration files and configuring Apache to serve the Nagios web interface. You only need to perform this section once on your Nagios server.

Open the main Nagios configuration file in your text editor:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

Find this line in the file:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

    ...
    #cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers
    ...

Uncomment this line by deleting the `#` character from the front of the line:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

    cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers

Save the file and exit the editor.

Now create the directory that will store the configuration file for each server that you will monitor:

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers

Open the Nagios contacts configuration in your text editor:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

Find the `email` directive and replace its value with your own email address:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg

    ...
    define contact{
            contact_name nagiosadmin ; Short name of user
            use generic-contact ; Inherit default values from generic-contact template (defined above)
            alias Nagios Admin ; Full name of user
            email your_email@your_domain.com ; << *****CHANGE THIS TO YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS******
    ...
    

Save and exit the editor.

Next, add a new command to your Nagios configuration that lets you use the `check_nrpe` command in Nagios service definitions. Open the file `/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg` in your editor:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg

Add the following to the end of the file to define a new command called `check_nrpe`:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg

    ...
    define command{
            command_name check_nrpe
            command_line $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -c $ARG1$
    }

This defines the name and specifies the command-line options to execute the plugin. You’ll use this command in Step 5.

Save and exit the editor.

Now configure Apache to serve the Nagios user interface. Enable the Apache `rewrite` and `cgi` modules with the `a2enmod` command:

    sudo a2enmod rewrite
    sudo a2enmod cgi

Use the `htpasswd` command to create an admin user called **nagiosadmin** that can access the Nagios web interface:

    sudo htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Enter a password at the prompt. Remember this password, as you will need it to access the Nagios web interface.

**Note:** If you create a user with a name other than **nagiosadmin** , you will need to edit `/usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg` and change all the **nagiosadmin** references to the user you created.

Now create a symbolic link for `nagios.conf` to the `sites-enabled` directory. This enables the Nagios virtual host.

    sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/

Next, open the Apache configuration file for Nagios.

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

If you’ve configured Apache to serve pages over HTTPS, locate both occurrences of this line:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

    # SSLRequireSSL

Uncomment both occurrances by removing the `#` symbol.

If you want to restrict the IP addresses that can access the Nagios web interface so that only certain IP addresses can access the interface, find the following two lines:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

Comment them out by adding `#` symbols in front of them:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

    # Order allow,deny
    # Allow from all

Then find the following lines:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

    # Order deny,allow
    # Deny from all
    # Allow from 127.0.0.1

Uncomment them by deleting the `#` symbols, and add the IP addresses or ranges (space delimited) that you want to allow to in the `Allow from` line:

/etc/apache2/sites-available/nagios.conf

    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.1 your_ip_address

These lines appear twice in the configuration file, so ensure you change both occurrences. Then save and exit the editor.

Restart Apache to load the new Apache configuration:

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

With the Apache configuration in place, you can set up the service for Nagios. Nagios does not provide a Systemd unit file to manage the service, so let’s create one. Create the `nagios.service` file and open it in your editor:

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nagios.service

Enter the following definition into the file. This definition specifies when Nagios should start and where Systemd can find the Nagios application. Learn more about Systemd unit files in the tutorial [Understanding Systemd Units and Unit Files](understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files)

/etc/systemd/system/nagios.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Nagios
    BindTo=network.target
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=nagios
    Group=nagios
    ExecStart=/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

Save the file and exit your editor.

Then start Nagios and enable it to start when the server boots:

    sudo systemctl enable /etc/systemd/system/nagios.service
    sudo systemctl start nagios

Nagios is now running, so let’s log in to its web interface.

## Step 4 — Accessing the Nagios Web Interface

Open your favorite web browser, and go to your Nagios server by visiting `http://nagios_server_public_ip/nagios`.

Enter the login credentials for the web interface in the popup that appears. Use **nagiosadmin** for the username, and the password you created for that user.

After authenticating, you will see the default Nagios home page. Click on the **Hosts** link in the left navigation bar to see which hosts Nagios is monitoring:

![Nagios Hosts Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendocs-md/do-tutorials-images/master/img/nagios/hosts_link.png)

As you can see, Nagios is monitoring only “localhost”, or itself.

Let’s monitor our other server with Nagios,

## Step 5 — Installing NPRE on a Host

Let’s add a new host so Nagios can monitor it. We’ll install the Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) on the remote host, install some plugins, and then configure the Nagios server to monitor this host.

Log in to the second server, which we’ll call the **monitored server**.

    ssh sammy@your_monitored_server_ip

First create create a “nagios” user which will run the NRPE agent.

    sudo useradd nagios

We’ll install NRPE from source, which means you’ll need the same development libraries you installed on the Nagios server in Step 1. Update your package sources and install the NRPE prerequisites:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgd2-xpm-dev openssl libssl-dev unzip

NRPE requires that [Nagios plugins](https://www.nagios.org/downloads/nagios-plugins/) is installed on the remote host. Let’s install this package from source.

Find the latest release of Nagios Plugins from the [Nagios Plugins Download](http://nagios-plugins.org/download/?C=M;O=D) page. Copy the link address for the latest version, and copy the link address so you can download it to your Nagios server.

Download Nagios Plugins to your home directory with `curl`:

    cd ~
    curl -L -O http://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz

Extract the Nagios Plugins archive:

    tar zxf nagios-plugins-*.tar.gz

Change to the extracted directory:

    cd nagios-plugins-*

Before building Nagios Plugins, configure it to use the **nagios** user and group, and configure OpenSSL support:

    ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-openssl

Now compile the plugins:

    make

Then install them:

    sudo make install

Next, install NRPE. Find the download URL for the latest stable release of NRPE at the [Nagios Exchange site](https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Monitoring-Agents/NRPE--2D-Nagios-Remote-Plugin-Executor/details) just like you did in Step 1. Download the latest stable release of NRPE to your monitored server’s home directory with `curl`:

    cd ~
    curl -L -O https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/releases/download/nrpe-3.2.1/nrpe-3.2.1.tar.gz

Extract the NRPE archive with this command:

    tar zxf nrpe-*.tar.gz

Then change to the extracted directory:

    cd nrpe-*

Configure NRPE by specifying the Nagios user and group, and tell it you want SSL support:

    ./configure --enable-command-args --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-ssl=/usr/bin/openssl --with-ssl-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

Now build and install NRPE and its startup script with these commands:

    make all
    sudo make install
    sudo make install-config
    sudo make install-init

Next, let’s update the NRPE configuration file:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg

Find the `allowed_hosts` directive, and add the private IP address of your Nagios server to the comma-delimited list:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg

    allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,::1,your_nagios_server_private_ip

This configures NRPE to accept requests from your Nagios server via its private IP address.

Save and exit your editor. Now you can start NRPE:

    sudo systemctl start nrpe.service

Ensure that the service is running by checking its status:

    sudo systemctl status nrpe.service

You’ll see the following output:

    Output...
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios systemd[1]: Started Nagios Remote Plugin Executor.
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios nrpe[14653]: Starting up daemon
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios nrpe[14653]: Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 5666.
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios nrpe[14653]: Server listening on :: port 5666.
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios nrpe[14653]: Listening for connections on port 5666
    Oct 16 07:10:00 nagios nrpe[14653]: Allowing connections from: 127.0.0.1,::1,207.154.249.232

Next, allow access to port `5666` through the firewall. If you are using UFW, configure it to allow TCP connections to port `5666`:

    sudo ufw allow 5666/tcp  

You can learn more about UFW in [How To Set Up a Firewall with UFW on Ubuntu 16.04](how-to-set-up-a-firewall-with-ufw-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Now you can check the communication with the remote NRPE server. Run the following command on the Nagios server:

    /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_nrpe -H remote_host_ip

You’ll see the following output:

    OutputNRPE v3.2.1

Now let’s configure some basic checks that Nagios can monitor.

First, let’s monitor the disk usage of this server. Use the `df -h` command to look for the root filesystem. You’ll use this filesystem name in the NRPE configuration:

    df -h /

You’ll see output similar to this:

    OutputFilesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    udev 490M 0 490M 0% /dev
    tmpfs 100M 3.1M 97M 4% /run
    /dev/vda1 29G 1.4G 28G 5% /
    tmpfs 497M 0 497M 0% /dev/shm
    tmpfs 5.0M 0 5.0M 0% /run/lock
    tmpfs 497M 0 497M 0% /sys/fs/cgroup
    /dev/vda15 105M 3.4M 102M 4% /boot/efi
    tmpfs 100M 0 100M 0% /run/user/0

Locate the filesystem associated with `/`. On a Droplet, the filesystem you want is probably `/dev/vda1`.

Now open `/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg` file in your editor:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg

The NRPE configuration file is very long and full of comments. There are a few lines that you will need to find and modify:

- **server\_address** : Set to the private IP address of the monitored server
- **command[check\_hda1]**: Change `/dev/hda1` to whatever your root filesystem is called

Locate these settings and alter them appropriately:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg

    ...
    server_address=monitored_server_private_ip
    ...
    command[check_vda1]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_disk -w 20% -c 10% -p /dev/vda1
    ...

Save and exit the editor.

Restart the NRPE service to put the change into effect:

    sudo systemctl restart nrpe.service

Repeat the steps in this section for each additional server you want to monitor.

Once you are done installing and configuring NRPE on the hosts that you want to monitor, you will have to add these hosts to your Nagios server configuration before it will start monitoring them. Let’s do that next.

## Step 6 – Monitoring Hosts with Nagios

To monitor your hosts with Nagios, you’ll add configuration files for each host specifying what you want to monitor. You can then view those hosts in the Nagios web interface.

On your Nagios server, create a new configuration file for each of the remote hosts that you want to monitor in `/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/`. Replace the highlighted word, `monitored_server_host_name` with the name of your host:

    sudo nano /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/your_monitored_server_host_name.cfg

Add the following host definition, replacing the `host_name` value with your remote hostname, the `alias` value with a description of the host, and the `address` value with the private IP address of the remote host:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/your\_monitored\_server\_host\_name.cfg

    define host {
            use linux-server
            host_name your_monitored_server_host_name
            alias My client server
            address your_monitored_server_private_ip
            max_check_attempts 5
            check_period 24x7
            notification_interval 30
            notification_period 24x7
    }

With this configuration, Nagios will only tell you if the host is up or down. Let’s add some services to monitor.

First, add this block to monitor CPU usage:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/your\_monitored\_server\_host\_name.cfg

    define service {
            use generic-service
            host_name your_monitored_server_host_name
            service_description CPU load
            check_command check_nrpe!check_load
    }

The `use generic-service` directive tells Nagios to inherit the values of a service template called **generic-service** which is predefined by Nagios.

Next, add this block to monitor disk usage:

/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/your\_monitored\_server\_host\_name.cfg

    define service {
            use generic-service
            host_name your_monitored_server_host_name
            service_description /dev/vda1 free space
            check_command check_nrpe!check_vda1
    }

Now save and quit. Restart the Nagios service to put any changes into effect:

    sudo systemctl restart nagios

After several minutes, Nagios will check the new hosts and you’ll see them in the Nagios web interface. Click on the **Services** link in the left navigation bar to see all of your monitored hosts and services.

## Conclusion

You’ve installed Nagios on a server and configured it to monitor CPU and disk usage of at least one remote machine.

Now that you’re monitoring a host and some of its services, you can start using Nagios to monitor your mission-critical services. You can use Nagios to set up notifications for critical events. For example, you can receive an email when your disk utilization reaches a warning or critical threshold, or a notification when your main website is down. This way you can resolve the situation promptly, or even before a problem even occurs.
