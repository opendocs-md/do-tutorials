# Suggested Topics for Tutorials

Our tutorials help people like you solve some of their trickiest problems. Whether they’re building out some infrastructure or writing a web application, readers trust our tutorials because they’re written for developers by developers.

We’d love your help publishing articles that help developers get their apps into production.

We’re particularly interested in the following types of articles:

- Tutorials that walk readers through using or deploying software on [Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/).
- Tutorials that show readers how to use DigitalOcean products like [Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/), [Block Storage](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/block-storage/), and [Load Balancers](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/load-balancer/) in real-world applications.
- Production-focused tutorials covering topics like load balancing, automatic backups, database management, failovers, security, monitoring, logging, vertical/horizontal scaling, testing, optimization, etc.

In addition, we’re looking for tutorials on the following topics:

- How to build a Hashicorp Vault server using Packer and Terraform on DigitalOcean

If you need additional inspiration, here are some examples of recent tutorials we’ve published that illustrate what we’re looking for:

To share your knowledge on any of these topics by writing a tutorial for the DigitalOcean community, [apply to the Write For DOnations program](https://do.co/w4do) by submitting a writing sample [in our style](http://do.co/style). We’ll evaluate your sample and, once you’re approved, we’ll work with you to develop an outline for your topic and help you get published.

We can’t wait to see your writing sample. And if you have other topic ideas, just [let us know when you apply](https://do.co/w4do).
