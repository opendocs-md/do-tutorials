# Write for DOnations - Frequently Asked Questions

The Write for DOnations program brings together two initiatives: building reference content to help developers, and supporting tech-focused charities and nonprofits.

Authors who contribute to our growing collection of tutorials on open-source software deployment, configuration, and development will also have the opportunity to give back to a growing [list of tech-focused nonprofits](write-for-donations-faq#what-charities-and-nonprofits-will-my-writing-support). Our goals are to enable authors to give back to the DigitalOcean and open-source communities, and to strengthen these communities by supporting the work of charities, nonprofits, and activists.

# FAQ

## How is Write for DOnations different from Write for DigitalOcean?

The difference is the name of the program, the increase in typical payout amounts, and the addition of a charitable donation to the payout for an article. This change applies to all new and existing community authors.

The editorial process for Write for DOnations will remain the same: an initial submission, followed by a round of collaboration and editorial review, and a final publication.

Authors will be paid upon publication of their work, just as in the Write for DigitalOcean program. Write for DOnations additionally matches that payout in the form of a contribution from DigitalOcean to tech-focused nonprofits chosen from [our list of funds](write-for-donations-faq#which-charities-and-nonprofits-will-my-writing-support).

## What is the payout structure for Write for DOnations?

The typical payout for community authors in the Write for DOnations program is $300 for typical tutorial content. Write for DOnations additionally matches this payout in the form of a contribution from DigitalOcean to the author’s choice of tech-focused nonprofits from [our list of funds](write-for-donations-faq#which-charities-and-nonprofits-will-my-writing-support).

Authors can receive their payout via PayPal or in DigitalOcean credit, and DigitalOcean will make donations using [Bright Funds](https://www.brightfunds.org).

We are continuously exploring additional charities and funds which may be a good match.

## Can I choose the charity or nonprofit that will receive the matching payout?

Authors can choose to donate to one of the four funds we support, which splits the donation equally among the nonprofits in the fund. Authors can alternatively choose to donate the full amount to one specific nonprofit from within those funds.

At this time, it is not possible for authors to select a charity or nonprofit that is not on our list, but we hope to expand the program in the future to include this capability.

## Will my donation be tax-deductible?

Because DigitalOcean will be processing the donation through Bright Funds, it won’t be possible for you to claim it as a charitable deduction on your tax return.

## How long will the Write for DOnations program last?

The Write for DOnations program is our current program for publishing content from our community.

Should we decide to end the Write for DOnations program, we will provide advance notice to all participating authors. This notice will include information on when payout amounts will no longer be matched by charitable donations.

## I am already a community author. How do I participate in Write for DOnations?

Existing community authors are automatically included in Write for DOnations. The new payouts apply to existing and new authors alike.

## I am a first-time author. Can I make updates to a DigitalOcean tutorial?

At this time, we ask all first-time authors to first write an original tutorial in order to gain a better understanding of our style and technical requirements.

## Can I translate a DigitalOcean tutorial?

At this time, we are not accepting translations for publication. You may publish a translation of your own, using the guidelines described in the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommericial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

## I have questions and/or thoughts about the Write for DOnations program. Where can I share them?
