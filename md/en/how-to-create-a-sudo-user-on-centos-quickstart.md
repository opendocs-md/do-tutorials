# How To Create a Sudo User on CentOS [Quickstart]

## Introduction

The `sudo` command provides a mechanism for granting administrator privileges, ordinarily only available to the root user, to normal users. This guide will show you the easiest way to create a new user with sudo access on CentOS, without having to modify your serverâ€™s `sudoers` file. If you want to configure sudo for an existing user, simply skip to step 3.

## Steps to Create a New Sudo User

1. Log in to your server as the `root` user.

2. Use the `adduser` command to add a new user to your system.

3. Use the `usermod` command to add the user to the `wheel` group.

4. Test sudo access on new user account
